# @ Please identify and update all instances of "@" found in this script appropriately.
# @ You will need to generate one or more test scripts that test your
# @ complete functionality, @(these scripts provide example geoips calls and
# @ sample output, as well as providing a full integration test),
# @ and call each script within the test_all.sh script.

# Do not rename this script or test directory - automated integration
# tests look for the tests/test_all.sh script for complete testing.

#!/bin/bash

# This should contain test calls to cover ALL required functionality tests
# for the @package@ repo.

# The $GEOIPS tests modules sourced within this script handle:
   # setting up the appropriate associative arrays for tracking the overall
   #   return value,
   # calling the test scripts appropriately, and
   # setting the final return value.

# Note you must use the variable "call" in the for the loop

# @ Pass the name of your package to "test_all_pre.sh", ie
