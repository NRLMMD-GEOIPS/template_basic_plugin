# @ "product_defaults" YAML files specify a given set of defaults for
# @ product specifications within GeoIPS.

# @ Replace all instances of @ within this template with appropriate values for
# @ your particular use case.
# @ Once complete, remove all lines containing "@" from this file.

# @ A "product" within GeoIPS is a set of steps required to process a dataset
# @ in a given way.

# @ The currently supported product types are specified in
# @ geoips/schema/product_defaults, with the associated required contents and
# @ formatting

# @ NOTE: Once the command line interface has been finalized, much of these
# @       instructions will be replaced with calls to the command line
# @       interface in order to identify available algorithms, colormaps, etc.
# @       In the meantime, these instructions will point you towards the code
# @       itself that is referenced in the various pieces of the product
# @       specification.


interface: product_defaults

# @ "family" is a string that identifies the valid fields within this product.
# @ These are currently specified within geoips/schema/product_defaults
# @ - your product type must match a valid schema.
# @ The product "family" also specifies what operations must be applied to the dataset
# @ for a given product, and in what order.  The processing workflows handle
# @ ensuring each step is applied appropriately based on the product "family"
# @ Thus, only supported product families will behave appropriately within
# @ GeoIPS.  If a new unsupported order of operations is required for a given
# @ product, support for that product_type must be added in the main GeoIPS
# @ infrastructure - please contact the GeoIPS Team if you require a new
# @ product_type.
family: interpolator_algorithm_colormap

# @ product "name" is the identifier for the current product
# @ Product "name" will be referenced within products/*.yaml product list files,
# @ where the actual required variable names will be identified for a given source.
# @ NOTE: Please use '-' as a delimeter in product names by GeoIPS convention.
# @ This allows using either '_' or '.' as a delimiter in filenames,
# @ another GeoIPS convention.
# @ Capitalization of each word in Product-Name can aid in human readability,
# @ but is not strictly required. GeoIPS *is* case sensitive.
