bug fix:
- description: |
    Fixed a small bug in template_basic_plugin's pyproject.toml. The file was
    incorrectly set up after the switch to poetry and my vscode TOML highlighter caught
    the error with the dependency.

Refactoring Updates:
  - description: |
      Replaced all occurences of ``run_procflow`` in the test scripts with ``geoips run``
      so the files don't conflict with the content in 2024 tutorial.
